### How?

#### *Planning Phase:*
- We came up with the concept of the app and gathered content and photographs that fit our theme.
- We saw some inspiration and the basis of news websites.
- we sketched a UI design to work in using Figma.
- And finally we divided up the workload accordingly.

#### *Development Phase:*
- in the first stage we chose what technologies do we need to use (shown below) and how to work in a team.
- we designed the ui using figma then we started dierectly in the HTML/CSS part so we can get done with the static part.
- and in the next days we gave every member of the team his tasks to be done in javascript and to apply TTD before writing their methods.
- after all of that we gathered the whole work on github and made the entire application.

## **User Journey**  :pencil2:
 When the user enters the 3amo Emad web application home, he/she can enter it either as a buyer or a customr on his own choice, then there are two diffirent pathes of the website:
 - first as a buyer, he can view items in front of him that the seller has added it previously, and he can shop and filter the choices based on his demand either by sorting the items according to price descending or ascending or by type of desired category. after that he can insert any of those items into his card then go to check it, after checking it he can increase quantity of items and delete them so then cant checkout his total orders with paying tax fee.
- second as a seller, he see much like a control panel, where he can add his own items to the store by clicking "add item" and fill the popped up box modal form then the product would be added successfully. also in the panel he can delete the items he did insert and edit their info.
